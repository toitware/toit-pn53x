Apparently the chip uses i2c clock stretching. Not sure that's supported needs to be tested.

In SPI mode one has to wait for the sensor to be ready again after getting an ACK.

Adafruit seems to expose the reset pin.
The elechouse board ties the reset to vcc.


Chip starts in vbatmode (or something like that) where it doesn't use power.
Needs to be woken up, and then changed to run in a mode where it doesn't immediately go to sleep again.
Might i2c more stable (despite the clock stretching).
All communication with the device should use timeouts and try again. We don't completely know the
oscillator frequency and how long the chip might need to wake up. Maybe something we can find out.
